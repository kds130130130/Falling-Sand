# CG-project

A simple physics-driven particle sandbox. 

The game is driven by the user's mouse. Particles can be "painted" by dragging the mouse or by clicking.  

Click on the drop down menu to pull up specific particles you can draw, an eraser (to erase particles) or quit by using the "Quit" option.

Different particles have different interactions. For example, water can be contained in walls, algae/plants permeate across water, seeds turn into trees when in contact with water, etc. 

A general summary of how the project works can be found in the report under "implementation". 

fallingsand.java is a test file that we've uploaded to see how github works with storing files and team projects.
